    "It's Friday night at 9:15 PM when David Thompson stumbles into the ER, hunched over and clutching his abdomen. The 19-year-old college freshman was supposed to be at a frat party tonight, but instead he's here, pale and sweating. His roommate drove him after David spent the last hour vomiting and couldn't stand up straight. 'It started yesterday as just a weird stomach ache,' David groans, 'but now it feels like someone's stabbing me on the right side.'",
    "Nurse Kelly gets him onto a gurney and begins her assessment. David's temperature reads 38.4°C - definitely running a fever. His heart rate is elevated at 98 bpm, likely from pain and stress. When she gently presses on his right lower abdomen at McBurney's point, David nearly levitates off the table. The rebound tenderness is unmistakable. He's guarding his abdomen, taking shallow breaths to avoid movement. Every bump in the road on the way here was agony. Classic signs are lining up: the pain migration from periumbilical to right lower quadrant, the fever, the vomiting, the positive rebound.",
    "This presentation screams appendicitis, but you need to be thorough. You can order blood work to check for elevated white blood cells and inflammatory markers. An X-ray might show some clues, though it's not the most sensitive test for appendicitis. The ECG will rule out any cardiac issues causing referred pain. The question is: how much time do you spend on diagnostics versus moving to treatment? An inflamed appendix is a ticking time bomb. Leave it too long, and it ruptures, spilling bacteria throughout the abdominal cavity and turning a routine surgery into a life-threatening emergency.",
    "Your decision will chart David's course. Choose surgery now, and he'll have a straightforward appendectomy with a quick recovery - back to classes in two weeks. Choose to observe with antibiotics, and you're gambling that the appendix won't rupture while you wait. Send him home with pain meds, and you're committing malpractice - he'll be back in worse condition. The surgical team is available and ready. His parents are on their way. What's the call, doctor? Do you operate, observe, or order more tests?"
