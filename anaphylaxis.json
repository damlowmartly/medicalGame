    "The automatic doors burst open as two frantic friends rush in supporting Emily Rodriguez, a 28-year-old graphic designer who can barely stand. Her face is swollen almost beyond recognition, covered in angry red welts. She's clutching her throat, making terrifying wheezing sounds as she struggles for each breath. Her friends are shouting over each other: 'She ate pad thai!' 'We didn't know there were peanuts!' 'She said her EpiPen was expired!' The restaurant is only two blocks away - this happened FAST.",
    "You sprint over as Nurse James already has Emily on a gurney. Her lips and tongue are grotesquely swollen, turning bluish. Hives cover every visible inch of her skin. She's trying to speak but can only produce strangled gasps. The pulse oximeter screams an alarm - 84% and dropping. Her heart is racing at 132 bpm, trying desperately to compensate for the lack of oxygen. Her eyes are wide with panic; she knows she's dying. This is textbook anaphylactic shock - a life-threatening emergency where minutes matter.",
    "Your mind races through the protocol. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. You could order tests to confirm the diagnosis and assess organ damage, but is there even time? Her airway is swelling shut right before your eyes. You need to choose treatment NOW. Epinephrine is the gold standard, but timing and adjunct therapies matter. Some treatments might help symptoms without addressing the core problem. Others might seem reasonable but could waste critical seconds.",
    "This is the moment where your knowledge and decisiveness will determine if Emily walks out of here or gets wheeled to the morgue. Choose epinephrine immediately with proper adjuncts, and you'll watch her airways open, her color return, and her grateful tears as she realizes she'll live. But hesitate, choose the wrong treatment, or underestimate the severity, and her airway will close completely within minutes, leading to cardiac arrest. Her friends are screaming for you to do something. What's your move, doctor?"
